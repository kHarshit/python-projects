# The Collatz conjecture is a conjecture in mathematics named after Lothar Collatz.
# The conjecture is also known as the "3n + 1 conjecture".

# The conjecture can be summarized as follows:
# Take any positive integer n. If n is even, divide it by 2 to get n / 2.
# If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1 to obtain 3n + 1.
# Repeat the process (which has been called "Half Or Triple Plus One", or HOTPO) indefinitely.
# The conjecture is that no matter what number you start with, you will always eventually reach 1.
